#### Overview
This repository contains some initial experimentation in applying a conditional bias correction to raw hydrologic model simulations (Qsim) in order to stabilize Stochastic Watershed Model (SWM) estimation. Results are shows for a case study at Shasta Reservoir (SHA) in California and both a LOESS model conditional bias correction and a Random Forest (RF) approach are explored.
